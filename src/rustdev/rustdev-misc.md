Random notes...

```bash

cargo doc --open ---- this will open only the manpages of your current git project
Ownership BTW ONLY 1 MUTABLE REF to mem is allowed.md
Ownership Transfer to Functions for Heap stuff like string, but not ints.rs
Ownership-GOOD-EXAMPLE.rs
reference is like a pointer but always guaranteed to point to valid memory
SemVer means Semantic versioning like rand 0.8.5.txt
unwrap() is same as expect() but wo msg
