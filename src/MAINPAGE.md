# Introduction

Welcome to my little notes page for random notes.

This is just a mdbook of random notes that I may update if needed, for now it is intentionally minimal.

Thanks for visiting, and please dont forget to support your community and donate to organizations like pancan (to help those sick with pancreatic cancer).

Thanks kindly!


# Misc (How to edit the mdbook!)
* Dont ever edit anything inside of ./book, only edit markdowns in ./src
* Run command: mdbook serve
* Then vi the SUMMARY.md or book.toml, and it will update left menu bar in real time.
* Now, mdbook serve, should have updated the searchindex.js based on your markdown edits etc, so git commit em up!

# Keyboard Shortcuts ⌨️
Anyone who knows me, knows I love webapps that fully support keyboard shortcuts. This book does so! Try typing the / character for example :P
| Shortcut        | Action                                               | Notes                              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ← (Arrow Left)  | Go to previous chapter/page                         | Fast navigation                    |
| → (Arrow Right) | Go to next chapter/page                             | Fast navigation                    |
| S or /          | Open search bar                                     | Instantly search chapters          |
| ?               | Open shortcuts/help menu                            | Shows all shortcuts                |
